# Myocardial Infarction Detection with Artificial Neural Network

Electrocardiogram(ECG) is an important tool in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases in humans. Correct diagnosis is very important in a MI. ECG is an important tool to analyze the functioning of the cardiovascular system. ECG records the heart’s electrical activity. Normal and abnormal beats of the heart are processed as electrical signals and transferred to a visual chart. However, it is quite difficult to visually interpret ECG signals. In this paper, we propose an approach that can automatically detect MI. We used the artificial neural network algorithm to detect normal and abnormal heartbeats. We used the PTB Diagnostics dataset in this project. We classified the data in two outputs, namely MI(abnormal) and healthy controls(normal). We achieved 91.2% accuracy in classification.
